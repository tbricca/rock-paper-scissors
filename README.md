## Instructions:

## Process: 
  ![Scrum](scrum.png) 

I built this game to better hone in my understanding of Jquery and Javascript as I had trouble with it on the previous deliverables. I begin by psuedo coding and drawing out the idea of the game in my notebook. I had thought about having a Player 2 option, but it seemed like it would defeat the challenge of the game if the player could see on the screen what the other player was going to use. I then utilized Trello and created a scrum board for it to help figure out my process.

 ## Design 

The game was designed to look like you're playing in a gladitator arena. I have the opponenets face off like a classic video game in order to make the game Rock, Paper, Scissors that much more appealing. There is a countdown timer to dramatize the feel of it and a scoreboard in the middle that announces who won each round.

## Next Steps

 My next steps will be to add a Player 2 function along with a few more animations to bring some more excitement to the game.
